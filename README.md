"# Automatic-question-generator-and-uploader" 

IDEA:

This automation is mainly used while handling instagram pages. So here my idea is to upload a 1 coding question per day for which i created a website and stored my data in a RESTFULL API using django. And then i called my api and converted my question into Image using python PIL library and used instabot to upload it to instagram.
